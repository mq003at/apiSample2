The node_module contains most of the modules required for the express server to be running. For some reasons, these modules don't work on my computer if I install it globally (env error), but you still can download just the .js file and install the module by yourself.

The module I have used for the projects are: express, url, fs, mongoose, body-parser. You also need your own mongodb on your computer to run it.
